<h1 align="center">Hi there! 👋</h1>

### 👀 About me

I am a Product/Ruby on Rails Engineer in love with backend. I try to follow the cake-driven development, always learning, growing, enjoying life, and working hard to one day be a good tech/team leader.
Love the challenge of crafting n-tier applications and fully feeling the end users' needs. Have experience building good application architecture, code refactoring, and readability. And also well-tested, robust REST web services that power web and native clients. Crafting and developing powerful and performant web applications/services using Ruby on Rails presents a lot to learn - architect and implement new system features, design and develop asynchronous workers to process time-consuming tasks, or even bug fixing and codebase refactoring.
